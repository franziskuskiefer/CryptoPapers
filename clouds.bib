# Important notes and limitations (due to currently used bibtex parser):
# * authors have to given as FIRSTNAME LASTNAME and ...
# * link to PDFs or website are given in "url" and should use url shortener (e.g. http://goo.gl/)
# * note tag is ignored while displaying, but content (comma separated list) can be used to search
